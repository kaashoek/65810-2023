<h2>Logistics</h2>

 <p>Instructor: Frans Kaashoek (kaashoek@mit.edu)<br>
  Lecture: MW1-2.30 (3-370)<br>
 Discussion: <a href="https://piazza.com/class/lle0c4tvnqn7db/">Piazza</a>

<p>Grading: 10% class participation, 20% paper presentation, 30%
  intermediate project reports, 40% final project. There will be no
  exams. If it's clear you put significant effort into class
  discussion, the paper(s) for which you were the lead, the reports,
  and your project, you'll get an A.

<p>If you'd like to take this course, please send e-mail to
kaashoek@mit.edu with the two or three papers from the schedule for
which you'd most like to lead discussion, and a few sentences about
your relevant background and interests.

  
<h3>Project</h3>


<p>The main focus of 6.5810 is a project.  A good project will
  build/extend a system using a new idea or explore/measure an
  existing widely-used system in some interesting way. The project can
  be related to your graduate research, as long as it overlaps with
  the themes in the course. Collaboration is encouraged but not
  required: each project can be done in groups of two or individually.

<p>The project includes:
<ul>
  <li>
    a project proposal (a few paragraphs): your project idea, how you
    plan to evaluate it, and your teammate (if applicable).

    <li>a design report (1 page): the motivation and design of your
      system.

    <li>an implementation status report (1 page): the implementation status of system.

    <li>an initial result report (1 page):  your preliminary results.

    <li>a final report (roughly 6 pages), and presentation to the
      class.
      
</ul>

<h3>Paper Discussion</h3>

<p>Most class meetings will consist of paper discussions. Everyone
should read each paper and be prepared to argue about it, both about
technical details and the extent to which the paper's design and ideas
seem promising. Each paper discussion will be led by a student. For
the paper(s) you're assigned to lead, you should come to class
prepared with:

<ul>
<li>A introduction (should be quick, since everyone has read the paper).
<li>Where the paper fits into an overall picture of serverless computing.
<li>A summary of what we should learn from the paper: interesting
ideas and lessons.
<li>Opinions about whether the system is likely to be useful
and successful.
<li>Experience using and/or programming the system, if that is
possible (download the software and run it, play with their
web site, etc.). Feel free to project a demo from your laptop.
<li>Explanations of important techniques that may be
hard to understand.
<li>Background or related information you find by following links,
searching, or reading cited work.
<li>Areas in which the system seems weak, particularly areas
in which new research and ideas seem to be needed.
<li>Questions for the class to consider.
</ul>
