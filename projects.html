  <p>Many of the possible project below involve SigmaOS, because that
    is what I am thinking about, but it is not a requirement to use
    SigmaOS (or use any suggestion from the list). Some of the
    suggestions can probably be morphed into a SigmaOS-independent
    direction. Most of the suggestions below are not well-defined
    projects; they are a starting point for brainstorming.

   <ul>
     <li>Paper focused:
       <ul>
	 <li>Take any from the papers and implement it yourself, or
	   measure/extend the authors' implementation in interesting
	   ways.
       </ul>
    <li>Application focused:
    <ul>
      <li> build/port Ray-like system to SigmaOS
      <li> build a gg-like system for SigmaOS
      <li> implement ExoFlow in SigmaOS's MapReduce library
    </ul>
    <li>Infrastructure focused:
      <ul>
	<li> implement WASM-based procs
	<li> support Python in SigmaOS
	<li> support many named's backed by one (or more) etcd's
	<li> use image-less containers to speed up Kubernetes
	<li> make SigmaOS run across clouds
	<li> make a vector-db cache
	<li> migrate procs
      </ul>
    <li>Fault-tolerance focused:
      <ul>
	<li> extend kvd's replicated state-machine library with blocking ops
	<li> make kvd store its state persistently
	<li> chain replicate kvd shards instead of using etcd's RAFT
	<li> make state of microservices fault tolerant
      </ul>
    <li>Security focused:
      <ul>
	<li> fuzz the proc-container interface
	<li> make a proc escape its realm in an interesting way
	<li> avoid running docker service as root
      </ul>
    <li>Utilization/performance focused:
      <ul>
	<li> Measure/study cgroup-based performance isolation
	<li> Measure/study Kubernetes controler and make it faster
	<li> Explore using swapping for BE and LC procs to share memory
	<li> Make kvd elastic with load changes
	<li> Use bidding/spot market for realms
      </ul>
    <li>Hardware focused:
      <ul>
	<li> Use RDMA to speed up, for example, non-linearizable reads
	in etcd
	<li> Allow procs to use GPUs
      </ul>
  </ul>
